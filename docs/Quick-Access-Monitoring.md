After logging into Cloud Pak for Data, you will be directed to the home page. If you are already logged in and want to navigate home, simply click on the IBM Cloud Pak for Data logo in the top left hand corner

## Opening the Monitoring Console

1. Click on the hamburger menu in the top left. Under Services, see "Instances". Click on it.
2. Find the service with "OpenScale" in it's name. On the right, click the three dots, and click "Open".
3. You should see a console view with a variety of different model deployment cards that you can click into to investigate further.


**Note**: If you still do not see model cards in the console or cannot access the service, then please contact an IBMer to assess your user permissions.
