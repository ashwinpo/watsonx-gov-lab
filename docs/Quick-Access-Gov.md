## Validating you have the correct profile

You should see a dashboard like the one below.

If not, let's make sure you are on the right profile. A Profile configures the user interface (UI) for a set of users. You will have more than one profile in your  system which will grant you access to different views.

Click on the persona icon in the top right. Click change profile > 
    
    - **watsonx-goverance MRG Master**: This will configure the UI to align with MRG use-cases. If you want to see a pre populated dashboard -- select this.
    - **watsonx-goverance Modules Master**: This will give you all the necessary permissions to create your own workflows. **Default to this.**
