**Complete!** You have successfully created an AI Use Case, representing a business problem that requires the use of AI models. You governed the Use Case by progressing it through an initial Use Case Request workflow, approving it at various stages. You also got an introduction into how that workflow is created and how it can be customized. Also, you completed an Applicability Assessment, similar to how other questionnaire assessments would be completed. The final step you did was completing the Use Case Review and then progressing the Use Case to Approved for Development. Great job! The next steps would be to create your models, evaluate them through the Monitoring Console, and then govern them via the Governance Console.
